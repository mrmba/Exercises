Model classes representing a `Recipe` and an `Ingredient` have been provided for you. **Do not modify or simplify the model's properties**
for this exercise.

You will need to implement a view to display the details of the recipe that the user clicked on.  The view should display all properties of the recipe as well as display a recipe image. Recipe images have been provided in the `images` directory. The recipe name reflects the `recipeId` of the corresponding recipe.
